# app/crud/__init__.py
# This file is simplified to avoid module-level imports that can cause circular dependencies
# or multiple model registrations. Individual CRUD functions will be imported directly
# where needed in API endpoints.

# No direct imports of .item, .folder, .image, .counts modules here.
# This file can be empty or contain package-level initialization if necessary.
